\title{West Central Pacific Ocean Bigeye Tuna (WCPO BET) Length Frequency Data}
\format{
A data.table with 7 columns:
year (integer), month (numeric), ts (integer), fishery (numeric),
bin (numeric), value (numeric), week (numeric).
Multiple rows per fishery-year-month (one per 2 cm length bin).
}
\source{
Extracted from MFCL (Multifan-CL) model frequency file outputs
and prepared for RTMB model input.
}
\usage{
wcpo_bet_lf
}
\description{
Length frequency composition data extracted from MFCL (Multifan-CL) frequency files
and prepared for RTMB (R Template Model Builder) stock assessment modeling.
Observations are organized by fishery, year, month, and 2 cm length bins.
}
\details{
\subsection{Data workflow}{

\strong{Preparation steps:}
\enumerate{
\item Extract length composition data from MFCL frequency file using \code{lnfrq()}
- Returns wide-format data with length bins as columns (10, 12, 14, ... 198 cm)
- Observations grouped by fishery-year-month
\item Reshape to long format (one row per fishery-year-month-length bin combination)
\item Merge with timestep table to add model timestep indexing consistent with catch/CPUE
\item Save as long-format data for RTMB model input
}
}

\subsection{Output columns}{

\describe{
\item{year}{Calendar year (1952-2018). Integer.}
\item{month}{Fishing quarter month (2, 5, 8, 11 representing Q1-Q4 approx.). Numeric.}
\item{ts}{Model timestep number (1-268 for 67 years × 4 quarters). Integer.}
\item{fishery}{MFCL fleet index (1-15). Numeric.}
\item{bin}{Length bin lower edge (cm). 2 cm bins: 10, 12, 14, ... 198. Numeric.}
\item{value}{Observed count of fish in this length bin. Numeric.}
\item{week}{Temporal indicator within quarter (typically 1 for aggregated data). Numeric.}
}
}

\subsection{Notes}{
\itemize{
\item MFCL data uses 2 cm length bins (10, 12, 14, ... 198 cm)
\item Data from \code{lnfrq()} represents observed length frequency
\item Sum of values across bins per fishery-year-month instance gives total input sample size
\item Bin values are left as counts for RTMB to handle (divide by sample size if proportions needed)
