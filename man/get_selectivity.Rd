\title{Compute selectivity-at-age from length-based selectivity curves}
\usage{
get_selectivity(data, par_sel, pla, len_mid)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A list containing model data. Required elements:
n_fishery, n_year, n_age, sel_type_f.}

\item{par_sel}{Numeric matrix of dimensions \verb{[n_fishery, 6]}. Each row is
a real-line parameter vector. For logistic (sel_type_f == 1), only
columns 1:2 are used. For double-normal (sel_type_f == 2), all 6 are used.}

\item{pla}{Numeric matrix of dimensions \verb{[n_len, n_age]} containing
probability-of-length-at-age (age-length key). Computed via \code{get_pla()}.}

\item{len_mid}{Numeric vector (length n_len) of length-bin midpoints.}
}
\value{
3D array \code{sel_fya} of dimensions \verb{[n_fishery, n_year, n_age]}.
}
\description{
Defines selectivity as a parametric function of length (logistic or
double-normal), then converts to selectivity-at-age by matrix-multiplying
with the probability-of-length-at-age (PLA/ALK).
}
\details{
Selectivity is currently time-invariant within each fishery (constant
across years).
