\title{Linear area rebinning of frequency data}
\usage{
rebin_counts(src_edges, src_counts, dest_edges)
}
\arguments{
\item{src_edges}{numeric vector (length N+1). Boundaries of source bins.
Must be monotonically increasing.}

\item{src_counts}{numeric vector (length N). Counts in each source bin.
May be an AD vector from RTMB.}

\item{dest_edges}{numeric vector (length M+1). Boundaries of destination bins.
Must be monotonically increasing.}
}
\value{
numeric vector (length M). Rebinned counts in destination bins.
}
\description{
Redistributes counts from source bins to destination bins using
proportional overlap. For each destination bin, the function finds
all source bins that overlap it and assigns a fraction of each
source bin's count proportional to the overlap width relative to
the source bin width.
}
\details{
AD-safe: src_edges and dest_edges are data; only src_counts may
carry AD values. The operation is linear in src_counts.
}
\examples{
# Identity rebin
edges <- 0:5
counts <- c(10, 20, 15, 5, 30)
rebin_counts(edges, counts, edges)

# Coarsen: merge pairs of bins
src_edges  <- 0:4
src_counts <- c(10, 20, 15, 5)
dest_edges <- c(0, 2, 4)
rebin_counts(src_edges, src_counts, dest_edges)
}
