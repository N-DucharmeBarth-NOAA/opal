## Overview

**opal** the **o**pen **p**opulation **a**ssessment **l**ibrary — is a fast, flexible, and modern R package for fisheries stock assessment. Built on [RTMB](https://github.com/kaskr/RTMB), opal provides a powerful framework for conducting quantitative population dynamics modeling and stock assessment analyses.

### Key Features

- **Fast**: Leverages RTMB's efficient automatic differentiation and optimization engine for rapid model fitting and sensitivity analyses
- **Flexible**: Modular design allows users to construct custom population models by combining readily available or custom process components
- **Modern**: Built with contemporary R programming patterns, extensive testing, and well-documented functions for reproducible, transparent science
- **Open & Accessible**: Released under open-source license with clear documentation; transforms complex stock assessment workflows into intuitive R functions, reducing barriers to entry and enabling collaborative development

### Purpose

opal is designed for fisheries scientists, stock assessment analysts, and population modeling researchers who need a transparent, reproducible, and collaborative framework for quantitative population assessment. Whether you're building novel models, conducting sensitivity analyses, or sharing transparent workflows with colleagues, opal provides the tools and infrastructure to make rigorous stock assessment accessible and reproducible.

## Installation

You can install the development version of opal from GitHub:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("N-DucharmeBarth-NOAA/opal")
```

Ensure you have RTMB installed:

``` r
install.packages("RTMB")
```

## Quick Start

``` r
library(opal)

# Build a basic population model
# (Example code will depend on your API—update with actual function calls)
```

## Core Functionality

opal provides tools for:

- **Population dynamics**: Model age/size structure, vital rates, and stock-recruitment relationships
- **Parameter estimation**: Fit models to fisheries data (catch, surveys, length compositions, etc.)
- **Inference**: Conduct Bayesian and frequentist analyses with uncertainty quantification
- **Diagnostics**: Evaluate model fit through residuals, retrospective analyses, and likelihood profiling
- **Projections**: Forecast population dynamics under different management scenarios

## Documentation

For detailed examples and function reference, see the [vignettes](vignettes/) and inline function documentation (`?opal`).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please open an issue or submit a pull request with enhancements or bug fixes.

### Branch Structure

opal uses a standard development workflow:

- **`main`**: Stable release branch. Code here represents tested, production-ready versions of the package.
- **`dev`**: Active development branch. New features, bug fixes, and improvements are developed and tested here before being merged into `main`.

**Workflow**: Submit pull requests against the `dev` branch. Once features are tested and validated, they are incorporated into `main` for release.

## License

See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for terms and conditions.

## Citation
